## üß© Introduction

The **Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game** is a firmware-level implementation of the classic 3x3 game, designed for STM32 boards.
It allows interaction via a **serial terminal (UART)**, where users input coordinates to place their mark.
The AI uses a **predefined move-selection algorithm**, adding a realistic delay to simulate computational thought.

The game flow:

1. Display the board on the terminal
2. Wait for user input (e.g., `a1`, `b3`)
3. Compute and print the AI move
4. Continue until a winner is found or a draw occurs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Hardware Setup

1. Connect the STM32 board to your PC via USB or serial adapter.
2. Ensure correct configuration for USART pins:

   *Use the default USART connection to comunicate*

3. Power the board and verify serial connection via your terminal program.

---

### 2. Software Setup

1. **Project Initialization**

   * Launch STM32CubeIDE
   * Create a new STM32 project and configure UART in CubeMX

2. **Code Integration**

   * Copy the provided source files into your project workspace
   * Include any required headers (`aifes.h` if using AI logic)

3. **Build & Flash**

   * Compile the firmware
   * Flash the binary to your STM32 board using ST-Link or STM32CubeIDE

4. **Serial Connection**

   * Open your serial terminal and configure it as follows:

     * **Baud rate**: 9600
     * **Data bits**: 8
     * **Parity**: None
     * **Stop bits**: 1
     * **Flow control**: None
   * Alternatively, launch the Python interface:

     ```bash
     python tic_tac_toe.py
     ```

## üéÆ How to Play

This project supports **three modes of interaction** with the Tic-Tac-Toe game:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Serial Connection Only

1. **Board Setup**

   * Flash the Tic-Tac-Toe firmware on the STM32 board.
   * The board initializes the game logic and sets up the board internally.

2. **Connect via USB / Serial**

   * Connect the board to your PC.
   * Launch the Python script to interact with the game:

     ```bash
     python tic_tac_toe.py
     ```

3. **Gameplay**

   * Moves are entered through the serial terminal (`a1`, `b2`, etc.).
   * The AI computes its moves and prints them in the terminal.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Serial Connection + LCD Screen

1. **Board & Display Setup**

   * Flash the firmware including SPI driver support for the LCD screen.
   * The STM32 board communicates with the screen over SPI.

2. **Connect and Launch**

   * Connect the board via USB to the PC for serial communication.
   * The board initializes both **game logic** and **LCD display**.

3. **Gameplay with Visual Feedback**

   * The Python script handles terminal input.
   * Game state and AI moves are also **displayed on the LCD screen**, providing live feedback.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Serial Connection + Python GUI

1. **Board & GUI Setup**

   * Flash the firmware on the STM32 as usual.
   * Navigate to the `Tic-Tac-Toe-GUI` folder.
   * (Optional but recommended) Create a Python virtual environment and install the required libraries:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # Linux / macOS
     venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Connect via USB / Serial**

   * The GUI communicates with the STM32 board over serial.
   * The board handles the game logic while the GUI handles display and input.

3. **Launch the GUI**

   * Start the interface:

     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

   * A GUI window will open showing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

   * Use the **dropdown menu** to manually select the connected board.

   * Once connected, you can start interacting with the game: making moves, seeing AI decisions in real-time, and tracking the game state directly from the GUI.

Your turn: Please enter coordinates (e.g., a3)
a1

User selected: a1

Current Board:
  O | a2 | a3
  -----------
  b1 | b2 | b3
  -----------
  c1 | c2 | c3

The AI took 15.000000 Œºs to think.

  -----------
  c1 | c2 | c3
